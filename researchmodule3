Notes On The Research For Module 3
William was originally found in a shaft associated with the tomb chapel of "The Steward, Senbi" at Meir, Egypt. We could not find an approximate date at which he was found, but the Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired him sometime in 1917 as a donation by Edward S. Harkness (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2018). We could not find any sources for the labour or motivations involved in the excavation of William, however we did find that Harkness purchased an entire tomb’s worth of artifacts to donate to the Met; we speculated whether William was perhaps within this collection, even if it was mostly comprised of artifacts from a different tomb. Again, we could not find any record of how the excavation process was conducted for the tomb chapel of the Steward Senbi. As mentioned in the paradata section, there were books in the library concerning excavation processes around 1917 in Egypt and one concerning important Egyptian artifacts. Both, however, were out on loan with due dates well past the due date of this module. The only online sources that the library could provide were encyclopedias of art history that were too general for what we needed to verify our narrative. They gave the same details that could be found on the Met’s website about William and we found it unnecessary to source these encyclopedias. The lack of sources meant that we had to build speculation and unreliability into our narrative to account for this.
