## Notes On The Research For Module 4

  For this particular module, which we based around William’s legs being broken, there was surprisingly little information to be found. From the article that the Metropolitan Museum of Art, we learned that William was found with broken legs during the original excavation of the tomb and that they were probably broken in order to protect the deceased from some sort of harm that a hippopotamus could do. This is only speculation on the museum's, however, and cannot be verified. Because our 3D model based on the replica of William does not have the cracks indicating which legs were broken and subsequently restored, the official pictures of him had were consulted in order to determine which legs should be the ones deleted from the AR model. Based on these pictures, it was determined that his front two legs, as well as his back right leg, were the ones that were broken. Unfortunately, we were also unable to verify this from any other source, credible or otherwise.
  The missing textures on the models also posed some problems for our AR because some of the object’s meaning was lost in terms of its historical imagery. The aquatic motif that was painted on William held significance as a link to the powerful force of the Nile, a symbol of death and rebirth. This may be the reason for why William's legs were broken in the first place: the hippo statue may have been symbolic of this force of the Nile, something that needed to be tamed for the safe passage of the deceased in the afterlife. This, however, is mainly based on our own speculation and would have only added a small amount of context to the audience - and only if they were to do more research into the object, as we have.
