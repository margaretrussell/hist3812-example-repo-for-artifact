To access our augmented reality project for this module, download the HP Reveal app and search for an Aura titled "William - With And Without Legs".

To view the Aura, follow the on-screen instructions, holding the phone in front of the trigger image until the model loads. Toggle between the model views by tapping the model on the screen.

In the case that the trigger image cannot be found, we have emailed it to you as an attachment.
