### Introduction:

As an important introductory note, we should clarify that we have failed in our attempt to create a coherent 3D model. For evidence of 
our efforts, however, we have included three screenshots of the project in various stages, as well as the .mix file of the project which 
may be opened in Meshmixer to view what we were trying to create, but could not export.

For the second module, we attempted to place two 3D models, one of William and one of a section of the Ishtar Gate, in proximity to each 
other. We found a 3D model of the Ishtar Gate to download and uploaded both models into Meshmixer. Kurt did most of the manipulation of the
models, as he had already had the object files on his computer, but discussion over the best method to manipulate the models continued 
throughout the process. As the notes below will reveal, the process did not go as smoothly as hoped.

### Process:

-Feb. 16th: Kurt downloaded Meshmixer and attempted to begin work on setting the model of William in relation to a model of the ancient 
Babylonian Ishtar Gate. A model of the Ishtar Gate was downloaded from this 
link: https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/u6ea9ec4e-9ee0-4762-982c-bbff4f136ea4/Ishtar-Gate  
Unfortunately, the model, when loaded in Meshmixer, appeared to have no surface decoration and only held the shape of the gate. Kurt 
attempted to fix this problem by adding shaders from Meshmixer, but these did not seem to help the situation much. Kurt tried uploading 
William only to find that William’s surface also would not load in Meshmixer and the shader’s surfaces were the only ones visible in the 
program. Kurt tried searching online but could find no way to erase shaders from a model’s surface.

-Feb. 18th: following several more attempts to restore William’s surface with no success, Kurt contacted professor Graham for assistance.

-Feb. 20th: professor Graham responded to the email, advising Kurt to reload the original model. Kurt downloaded the model of William he 
had uploaded to Sketchfab again and imported it into Meshmixer. This time, William’s surface was retained. Kurt spent some time using 
Meshmixer’s “Select” tool to “discard” parts of the base of the model that were not a part of William and might serve to confuse 
representations of him in juxtaposition with other models.

-Feb. 21st: Kurt finished “cleaning up” William in Meshmixer. He then imported the model of the Ishtar Gate into Meshmixer, choosing the 
“append” option when a choice was offered to either append or replace the current model of William. The Ishtar Gate appeared in 
Meshmixer’s space, overlapping slightly on some of William’s base. Using the “Edit” tool, Kurt translated William away from the overlapping
point and rotated him approximately 80 degrees to end up facing the Ishtar Gate. The Ishtar Gate, too, was translated so as to rest on a 
similar level to William.

-Feb. 25th: Kurt exported the new model of both William and the blank Ishtar Gate as an obj file. After clicking “save”, he received the 
following warning message from Meshmixer: “One or more objects being exported is complex (non-manifold). The resulting mesh file may have 
errors. Do you wish to continue or cancel exporting?” Kurt clicked “Continue”. As a test to see if the export worked, Kurt uploaded the 
obj file to Sketchfab only to find that William did not appear in the model - only the blank Ishtar Gate remained. After finding a thread 
on the issue from a google search (http://meshmixerforum.com/index.php?topic=1682.0), Kurt tried a proposed solution: he selected the 
Ishtar Gate and used the Inspector (under “analysis”) in Meshmixer. He double-clicked the circles that appeared to indicate points on the 
Gate (except for one that had the consequence of deleting a large segment of the model) and saved this version of the model separately. 
He then tried exporting the project as an obj file again only to receive the same error message as on the first attempt. Upon uploading 
the obj file to Sketchfab, the same problem was present, in that William remained absent. Returning to Meshmixer, Kurt attempted the same 
process on William with the Inspector tool. In this process, the model of William changed slightly in appearance: some of the gaps were 
filled in with a beige colour. Kurt then exported this version of the model; this time, no error message appeared. Kurt uploaded the 
resulting obj file to Sketchfab only to find that this time, the Ishtar Gate was absent from the model and William’s texture was missing. 
Kurt then tried re-uploading the model, this time with the obj, mtl and png files included. Unfortunately, this resulted in the same 
problem as the previous attempt. Kurt attempted to fix the Ishtar Gate in Meshmixer with the Inspector tool again, this time using a new 
method from the tool, the “Auto Repair All” option. After choosing this and clicking some of the circles that appeared, a large portion of
the gate disappeared. Kurt re-opened the file, discarding the old one, in an attempt to try the process again. He tried using the “select 
all” CTRL+A function and exporting this file. He received no error message. He tried uploading the resulting obj, mtl and png files to 
Sketchfab. Unfortunately, this resulted in the same issue as before, with no gate present and only a featureless model of William.
