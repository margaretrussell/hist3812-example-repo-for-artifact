### Macro - The Bigger Picture

  We attempted to “mash-up” our original 3D model of William with another model of the Ishtar Gate downloaded from another user’s site. 
  This would place the two artifacts, not normally seen together, in a dialogue with each other, similar to the way artists have 
  “mashed up” different songs, as in the reading on “Rethinking the Digital Remix” (Gunkel, 2008). As both artifacts depict animals in 
  different ways, we were hoping to use this “remix” to explore the materiality of these depictions with reference to Paul Reilly’s 
  matrices of “persistency and permeability” (Reilly, 2015). Looking at the display, one might get a sense of how artists in one culture 
  might have seen the original animals they depicted, living as unfolding beings somewhere between momentary and impermeable - the 
  exception being the dragons, which would have presumably been imaginary and thus are more in the realm of the seeping, absolutely 
  permeable and semi-persistent. The artists eventually might have formed their own “seeping” ideological visions of the animals which 
  they used permeable materials to create representations of. There is an additional element to the depictions of the animals on the 
  Ishtar Gate, in that they represent gods; thus the artists depicting the animals on the Ishtar Gate were also working from seeping 
  representations of the gods they believed were manifest in the forms of the animals they depicted. These representations of the animals, 
  once finished, became enduring, being largely persistent and impermeable - but not completely impermeable, since both William and the 
  Ishtar Gate have lost pieces over time and were subsequently restored, making them partially permeable while maintaining their 
  persistence. Digitizing the objects would be returning them permeability while bringing about an arguably higher degree of persistence, 
  situating them once again in the realm of the seeping.
	
  It seems, however, that technological limitations we encountered in the attempted mash-up have given the models an even more permeable 
  and possibly less persistent existence. To begin with, the Ishtar Gate we downloaded turned out to have none of the actual depictions of 
  the animals on its surfaces, or any markings at all - its surfaces were blank, holding only the shape of the gate without the decoration. This means any of the gate’s symbolic power through its animal/deity representations will be lost on a viewer who does not instantly recognize the gate’s shape. Further, we could not produce a coherent file to export from Meshmixer. This limits the ability to access the model we created at all; it would seem to have become even more fleeting from the fact that it can only be viewed with Meshmixer in its current most complete form, and Meshmixer is a technology that may deteriorate - it has no guarantee of being readable in a decade.
	
  These difficulties aside, the model may still have some ability to increase the aura of the original through the fact that it is 
  comprised of two imperfect replications (Latour & Lowe, 2011). The imperfections might serve to make one curious about the details in the
  appearances of the originals; perhaps one might be motivated to examine the animals and brickwork of the original Ishtar Gate when one 
  can only observe its general shape from the model.

  The blankness of the Ishtar Gate exemplifies the “programming is forgetting” that is a predominant theme throughout the course. The 
  Ishtar Gate that is being used with William was originally coloured in the display of the page from which it was downloaded, but once 
  downloaded it became blank with no way to attach the initial shader in a way that provided the likeness of the actual Ishtar Gate. 
  Although this was very frustrating, we believe it does not impact the availability of a model that was created primarily for ease of 
  public access. Ideally, a model being made for the public would be put into more capable hands of professionals with better technology 
  than Meshmixer. We do have to acknowledge the limits that our own technology presents and this is one such limit we encountered. This 
  might show the limits of an available model on the small scale, but certainly not of a model that might be provided to other digital 
  museums through authorized sources. This then necessitates a question on authorship: does the Pergamon Museum really own the gate? This 
  is a difficult question to answer. For all intents and purposes I think the Pergamon does own the physical gate. Should they own an 
  authorized copy? It seems like this would be advantageous to the purposes of preservation. Should they allow for anyone to obtain the 
  authorized copy for free? This is less in keeping with the museum’s goals of preservation, but if museums were truly created to educate 
  the public, as many claim they are, they are obligated to do so in such a way that allows the public to interact with the object freely. 
  We do not suggest “interacting freely” in terms of touching and possibly damaging the physical object, but perhaps interaction without 
  inhibitions such as the cost to go to the museum where the object is kept.

  The Pergamon Museum site does not give any indication for its having the gate any more than it being part of German excavations in the 
  area (Ancient Near Eastern Cultures, 2018). Interestingly enough, on the about section of the Museum’s site they reference Nazi 
  destruction of new art in the early 20th century, but do not give an explanation as to the conspicuous preservation of Ancient art. We 
  believe there could a connection here to nationalist narratives, as discussed in the lecture on Mussolini's use of Roman Art. Could Near 
  Eastern Art and Monuments have been similarly used as a source of propaganda?

### Micro - Process and Details

  It is important to note that the model of the Ishtar Gate we chose (which can be downloaded from this 
  link: https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/u6ea9ec4e-9ee0-4762-982c-bbff4f136ea4/Ishtar-Gate) differs from our model of William in 
  that it is not a model based on a 3D scan of the original object. It appears to be instead an original creation, a representation 
  comprised of digital 3D elements attributed in the description to Jonan Badal. Few other downloadable scans of the gate seem to be 
  available online; this was the best we could find for our purposes.
  
  Through our attempts to use Meshmixer, we created a number of different files that we hoped we might be able to upload, but experienced 
  difficulty with every single one. The difficulty seemed to stem from a problem relating to the complexity of one of the two models we 
  had imported, but we were unable to determine which it was or what we could do to fix it, despite many attempts to do so. We did end up 
  altering the appearance of William slightly. This change is present in the .mix file we have chosen to upload in place of a proper obj 
  file, since we were unable to obtain the latter. Therefore, though the model is not viewable in its obj form or on a site such as 
  Sketchfab, one might still see an approximation of what we were attempting by opening the .mix file in Meshmixer if they have the program.
