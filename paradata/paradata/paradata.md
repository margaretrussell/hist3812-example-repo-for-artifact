### Macro - The Bigger Picture

In our decision to construct a 3D model of "William", the faience hippopotamus originating from Egypt, we must be clear: we are not attempting to construct this model from the "original", but rather from a replica of the statue bought in a gift shop. This will pose a number of interesting implications for consideration.

The original statue is considered to be of some historical importance. In one respect, it seems inevitable that our model will lose some of that "aura" of historical importance, since it is being scanned from an imperfect replica of the original. Thus while the model will hopefully be recognizable to those familiar with William, it will be quite distinct from the original.

From this inherent fracture in the trajectory, we will find ourselves faced with options as to how we are to understand and (re)present the resulting 3D model. We may decide that this model is an "inferior" representation of William, as it is not an "objective" enough depiction. If we view the model in this way, it could perhaps be compared to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's own 3D model of William, measuring the improvements one is able to make when one has access to professional-grade scanning technology.

In fact, according to Latour and Lowe, our 3D model may help to strengthen the "aura" of the original. This would be a consequence of the model being yet another copy in a succession of copies from the original, heightening the value of the original through the multiplicity of varied copies of it in existence (Latour & Lowe, 2011).

Taking another perspective, we could attempt to digitally "mash up" our object with another, embracing its imperfection and making deliberate use of it. In this path, our model could end up more as a kind of "performance" or "interpretation" of the original (Latour & Lowe, 2011), or, as the Rhynie Woman arts collective dubbed their experiments in scanning, an "art.ifact" (Maxwell, 2017).

### Micro - Process and Details

In our scanning process, we attempted to create multiple models of William using both Scann3D and Regard3D, as well as allow each person in the group to create a photoset for modelling. This presented us with a range of models we could use for our purposes, though some ended up vastly more coherent and recognizable than others.

We ultimately decided to choose the model that we felt best represented William "objectively". This is partially because are not yet sure which direction we will take our model in yet, therefore it is best to go with the version that could make for the closest comparison to the Metropolitan Museum's model in the case that we decide to do this. The particular model was also chosen for its coherence because it will be easier to distort it or otherwise modify it from this original format if we decide to attempt this later on.

As previously mentioned, alternative scans and 3D models of William do exist and a future part of the project may be seeking out and comparing a number of these differeng models. Neither of our group's members have any previous experience in photogrammetry, scanning or 3D modelling and we have only very limited experience in programming.
