### Introduction:

Our goal in this module is to create a game with Twine that incorporates our 3D model (and possible variations of it) to tell a story about
the archaeological discovery of the original object the 3D model was based on - or rather, the original object that the object we scanned 
to make our 3D model was based on, as we only scanned a replica of it. It was decided that Kurt would handle most of the plotting out of 
the Twine story’s pathways and programming its “aesthetic” dimensions while Margaret would assist in writing parts of the story. The 
“skeleton” of the story was to be constructed first, using only bullet points for the plot which would later be filled in with more 
descriptive writing.

### Process Notes:

-March 9th: Kurt and Margaret discussed the plan for the plot of the game in Twine. Kurt mapped out the beginnings of some of the plot 
points.

-March 11th: Kurt finished a basic plan for the plot of the game in Twine, but the plan did not yet contain some of the programmable 
elements such as options that would be contingent on having made certain choices earlier in the game. These were kept track of via bullet 
points in the nodes of the story.

-March 13th: Using the Twinery guides, Kurt attempted to add in the contingent options using the (if: (history:) contains “ “) method. 
Initial attempts were only partly successful, as multiple contingent options following one another seemed to confuse the game and block 
the first option from being available even when it should have been. Kurt also tested a CSS option for adding images to the game and found 
a method for adding a tiled-image background, but did not explore this option further at that point.

-March 14th: Kurt asked professor Shawn Graham for help with the malfunctioning contingent options, but before emailing the html file to 
him, he managed to solve the problem on his own by re-assigning the destinations of the options to the titles of the new story nodes 
(which inexplicably seemed to add an inseparable “[“ bracket to the beginning of the title - Kurt decided this was not a serious issue 
impeding the game).

-March 16th: Kurt used the “Select” tool in Meshmixer to develop a version of the model of William that only had the feet of the hippo 
standing on the pedestal. He accomplished this by selecting and deleting every other part of the hippo’s body.

-March 17th: Kurt used the “Transform” function in Meshmixer to re-centre the model of William’s legs and uploaded the exported model to 
Sketchfab. As with previous instances of uploading Meshmixer-altered models to Sketchfab, all textures and colours were lost in the 
resulting model.

-March 18th: Kurt filled in the text to write the story for the Twine game. He also employed the “click-replace” function in some points of
the story to make “explorable environments” for the player, added several images and Sketchfab embeds, and changed the stylistic formatting
of the text and background. The background gradient came from uiGradients, while the font was imported from Google Fonts.
